### Academic Calendar to ICS Parser
*These scripts are not polished, and I stopped writing them as soon as they acomplished what I wanted*


#### getWSUCalendar.py
This script grabs the table [from WSU's official website](https://registrar.wsu.edu/academic-calendar/) that contains the current year's academic calendar and save it as a csv file.

#### parseWSUCalendar.py
This script takes the csv file generated by the previous script and converts it into an ICS file that can be imported to Apple/Microsoft/Google/etc calendars.
